Dementia caregivers have to overcome many obstacles to help and sustain their patients and loved ones. Metamorphoses that occur during neurodegenerative disease can lead to various difficulties with mundane tasks, such as eating and communication. In this article, we will present four examples of such struggles and equip you with the knowledge for their successful handling.

## Case 1: Loss of Appetite

One of the important behavioral changes in dementia patients is a decrease/increase in appetite. In either case, the taste and smell senses can be affected by the condition. In this scenario, it is crucial not to force the patient to eat against their will. Dementia patients take on visual anger and frustration easily, meaning their responsiveness will likely decrease even more.

Instead, keep the stakes low: offer small portions in a calm setting. If a try doesn’t work, wait for about 30 minutes and try again. It is often best to present it as something they are interested in. When you bring them a meal, say, “Here’s the meal you’ve asked for.” Another efficient approach is to invite them for help: “Could you please try this drink and tell me what it tastes like?” Person-centred choices and gentle re-tries tend to improve willingness to eat. [1]

Also, with senses becoming duller with age, trying out different flavourful food comes in handy. You can experiment with food temperature, taste, and texture. However, remember to always be alert of how the person chews and swallows. In many instances of Alzheimer’s, the motor functions of the tongue and jaw muscles tend to weaken. Therefore, it is often the best choice to favour soft pureed food, like soups, yogurts, and puddings. To improve safety, if the person can sit without discomfort, it is always best to make sure their posture is upright. [2]

Lastly, try to comfort them with your presence as much as possible. Sharing a meal or a drink tends to open them up and thus keep them safe.

## Case 2: Refuse to Bathe

Another common situation faced by caregivers is the refusal to bathe. Such an attitude roots from discomfort. Patients often feel scared because of how private showering is. This is why this task requires even more respect, attentiveness, and patience.

You have to understand that when you ask the person if they want to shower, “no” is the easiest answer that requires the least effort. It is for this exact reason that the best way to make them take a shower is to begin with the smallest step possible. “Can you come here, please?” is a very good starting point. From there, you also have to break down the process into incremental tasks like “move here, please” and “I’m going to turn on the water”. You should take on the role of a guide – in this situation, it is better to overexplain what you are doing. [3]

To prove that this experience is not as scary as they thought, you should keep track of their comfort. For example, keep asking whether the temperature is okay and offer the towel to warm them as soon as you finish. Remember, you have to make it as pleasant as possible to overcome the barrier. [4]

## Case 3: Sundowning and anxiety

It is quite typical for dementia patients to fall into a state called “Sundowning”. This feeling can be described as a form of strong anxiety and can be noticed if the person seems to look around too much or breathe heavily. 

The optimal strategy to fight sundowning is being involved and flexible. When you see that the person appears stressed, begin asking questions: “What is wrong?” or “Is it something in the room?” This will help you understand what makes them uncomfortable (keep in mind it can be something vague, not necessarily specific). From there, you can start attempting to alter whatever is the disruptor. Often, a possible solution is to slightly change the surroundings, e.g., going on a very short walk outside. [5]

A preventative method could be hanging a whiteboard with the patient’s schedule for the day. Seeing what is planned for every time in the day can help reduce the uncertainty and confusion that the patient experiences. More important than anything, in this case, is to show that you care about their concerns and are ready to act to resolve those. This way, you can strengthen your bonds despite dementia. [6]

## Case 4: *“I want to go home.”*

In the early and middle stages, when the person goes out in public, a situation where they desperately try to go home is not uncommon. Caused by various factors, it can be difficult to manage because patients often refuse to negotiate. [7]

What you should not do includes:

- Disregarding the emotions of the patient

- Simply stating that they “cannot” leave the place at the moment

- Trying to immediately distract from this concern

Instead, a better way to de-escalate the situation is to ask them about their needs. If the discussion doesn’t help and they still insist on returning home, try to validate their wishes. Even if there is no logical reason to leave, make sure they understand that you are ready to help them. Then, once they know you’re on the same side, suggest an excuse that makes sense, such as “I am waiting for my car to be fixed.” [8]

Finally, to redirect their attention, simply ask for help with any basic task you’re busy with – this will slowly shift their focus and help restore calmness. 

To conclude, most mundane problems of patients with Alzheimer’s and other diseases arise from fear, lack of understanding of their surroundings, and loss of some daily skills. To maximise the help we provide, it is vital to develop great patience and compassion, as well as use calm, strategic approaches to show that there is nothing to be scared of.
